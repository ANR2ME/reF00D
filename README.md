With @juliosueiras and TheRadziu - @AluProductions

## How to use:
  1. Add it to your taihen config.txt or use Autoplugin to install it.
  2. The release version does not work with plugin loader and must be used in taihen config.txt
  3. Make sure that reF00D is installed AFTER NoNpDRM in this config.
  4. Put keys.bin into ur0:/tai/keys.bin (you must restart after changing the keys.bin)
  
  NOTE: rePatch module loading will take priority over reF00D.

To Silica for his mental illness (actually caring about PSM) which made us realize the headers weren't always in order.
